# UniEnterpriseModule
This repository contains code from my "Enterprise Programming" module at university. 
This module used Java and Javascript to create a movie management databse. Users can add, update and delete films as well as browse existing ones.

## Key points from this module:
- Java back-end with CRUD funcitonality
- Funcitonal using XML, JSON and Plain Text (custom implementation)
- MVC used to practice full-stack development
- REST API written to connect front-end and back-end

### Here, two main folders can be found:
1. film-db-MVC (Model-View-Controller implentation)
2. film-db-API2 (REST API implementation)
