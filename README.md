# UniEnterpriseModule
This repository contains code from my "Enterprise Programming" module at university. 
This module used Java and Javascript to create a movie management databse. Users can add, update and delete films as well as browse existing ones.

Here, two main folders can be found:
1. film-db-MVC (Model-View-Controller implentation)
2. film-db-API2 (REST API implementation)

This module was focused mostly on the Java Backend and CRUD functionality.
